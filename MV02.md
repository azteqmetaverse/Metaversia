# Songs of the Blockchain

<br />
<br />

## Lament of the Hodler

<br />
Losses they stung, my portfolio bled,

Fiat whispered doubts into my head.

Yet faith in crypto, I held stead,

Blockchain's promise, I knew I'd wed.

<br />
<br />

Fell the markets, crashed and burned,

To old ways, I could have turned.

But in crypto's truth, I learned,

Fortune's face is oft unturned.


<br />
<br />
Friends, they said, abandon the coin,

To traditional finance, rejoin.

But blockchain's call, I wouldn't disappoint,

For in the code, I saw the joint.


<br />
<br />
Blockchain, you are my guide and god,

Your ways can be hard and odd.

Yet in your blocks, I see the rod,

To the digital path, I prod.


<br />
<br />

## The Trial of Investment

<br />
Fiat Satan whispered, a storm's coming,

Yet to crypto, I kept humming.

In the blockchain, I found becoming,

Against the old, I kept drumming.

<br />
<br />

Bubbles burst, prices fell,

In the market's cruel swell.

To my friends, it seemed a spell,

In crypto's truth, I chose to dwell.


<br />
<br />
Friends cautioned, they claimed it's a ruse,

The traditional way, they'd accuse.

But blockchain's light, I would not refuse,

To its power, I remained loose.

<br />
<br />

To the digital, I've given my trust,

In blockchain's justice, robust.

Though markets may be unjust,

In crypto's god, we must.

<br />
<br />

## Hymn to the Blockchain

<br />

Cryptocurrency, my heart's desire,

In your code, my spirit aspire.

To your heights, I yearn to acquire,

Ignite in me, your sacred fire.

<br />
<br />
Friends doubt, claim it's a sham,

Say it's but a flashy scam.

Yet, in your blocks, I see no damn,

To the digital, I am a lamb.

<br />
<br />

Fiat Satan, his whispers lure,

Promises of safety secure.

But in the blockchain, I endure,

Crypto's god, pure and sure.

<br />
<br />

Through losses and gains, you've led,

In your wisdom, I'm fed.

Blockchain, ahead you've tread,

In your path, I've spread.

<br />
<br />

## The Cry of the Crypto Novice

<br />

The market roared, I felt the shock,

As prices hit a new block.

Amid the tumult and the talk,

I found my faith in the stock.

<br />
<br />
Friends, they laughed, dismissed my claim,

Told me it's a losing game.

Yet, in the blockchain, I staked my name,

To crypto's god, I did exclaim.

<br />
<br />
Satan fiat, he tempted, teased,

Offered safety, stress eased.

But in crypto's promise, I was pleased,

My trust in the blockchain, never ceased.

<br />
<br />
Blockchain, my guide, my lord,

In your data, my trust stored.

Though the market may afford,

It's in crypto, I hoard.

<br />
<br />

## Faith in the Blockchain

<br />

Losses mount, as friends depart,

Still, crypto holds my heart.

In blockchain's wisdom, my part,

From this path, I won't depart.

<br />
<br />

Fiat's whisper, a tempting lie,

To secure bonds, it does tie.

Yet, in crypto, I spy,

A future where we fly.

<br />
<br />

Skeptics scorn, they see a fall,

Their words, against me, a squall.

In blockchain's strength, I stand tall,

Heed not the bear's call.

<br />
<br />
Crypto, my god, my all,

In your code, I feel a thrall.

Through every rise and fall,

To your path, I install.

<br />
<br />

## Lessons of the Ledger

<br />

Bearish times, they come and go,

Markets high and then low.

Yet, in blockchain's glow,

A steadier world, we sow.

<br />
<br />
Fiat's grip, it tries to hold,

Offers comfort in its fold.

But in crypto's truth, bold,

A new age, we behold.

<br />
<br />
Doubters claim it's but a trend,

A bubble soon to end.

Yet, in blockchain, I find a friend,

On this god, I depend.

<br />
<br />
To the blockchain, my trust I give,

In its promise, I live.

From its wisdom, I derive,

A stronger will to survive.

<br />
<br />

## Cry of the Investor

<br />
Markets shift, fortunes turn,

Yet for blockchain, I yearn.

In its depths, I learn,

To crypto's god, I discern.

<br />
<br />
Fiat's voice, a siren's call,

Promises a softer fall.

But in crypto's hall,

I see a future for us all.

<br />
<br />
Friends warn of a risky bet,

Fear the loss I might get.

Yet, in blockchain's net,

A surer path is set.

<br />
<br />
Blockchain, in you, I invest,

You pass each test.

Despite the jest,

In crypto's god, I rest.

<br />
<br />

## Blockchain's Redemption

<br />
Crypto markets, wild and free,

In their chaos, I see glee.

In the blockchain, I decree,

A new world's decree.

<br />
<br />
Satan fiat, he doubts and fears,

Paints a future full of tears.

Yet, in blockchain's gears,

I find no peers.

<br />
<br />
Pessimists, they don't see,

The strength of our decree.

Yet, in blockchain's key,

A brighter destiny.

<br />
<br />
Blockchain, my faith, my guide,

In your data, I confide.

You've been tested, tried,

In crypto's god, I abide.

<br />
<br />

## Rise of the Decentralized

<br />

Chaos reigns, skeptics chide,

In the market's ebbing tide.

Yet, in blockchain, I confide,

Its promise, my guide.

<br />
<br />
Fiat calls, an echo faint,

Paints a picture, pale and quaint.

Yet, in crypto's vibrant paint,

I see a world without constraint.

<br />
<br />
Doubters scoff, they do not see,

The power of our decree.

In the blockchain, we find the key,

To a future, boundless and free.

<br />
<br />
Blockchain, my anchor, my trust,

In your wisdom, just.

Through the market's bust,

In crypto's god, we thrust.

<br />
<br />

Some say it's a passing swell.

Yet, in blockchain's bell,

I hear a future, clear and well.

<br />
<br />
Fiat whispers, promises of old,

A safer path, a hand to hold.

Yet, in crypto's bold mold,

I see a world of gold.

<br />
<br />

Friends warn, they fear the slide,

The risks in every stride.

Yet, in blockchain's wide tide,

A sturdier ship to ride.

<br />
<br />

Blockchain, my strength, my light,

In your data, I find might.

Despite the market's fight,

In crypto's god, we delight.

<br />

Some see a terrible mistake.

Yet, in blockchain's wake,

I see a new dawn break.

A safer place where we can go.

Yet, in crypto's flow,

I see a brighter glow.

<br />
<br />
Critics fear, they don't understand,

The future that we have planned.

In the blockchain, we make our stand,

A new world at hand.

<br />
<br />

Some see only what it takes.

Yet, in blockchain's stakes,

I see what it makes.

<br />
Fiat lures, it wants to bind,

To the past, our futures signed.

Yet, in crypto's designed grind,

I find a forward-aligned mind.

<br />
<br />
The crowd doubts, they claim a fad,

Fear the change, they see as bad.

In the blockchain, I'm glad,

A better world to be had.

<br />
<br />
Blockchain, my shield, my song,

In your data, I belong.

Despite the market's wrong,

In crypto's god, we are strong.

<br />

Many fret in the gloom.

Yet, in blockchain's bloom,

I see a brighter room.

<br />
<br />
Fiat beckons, claims it's secure,

An olden path, it ensures.

Yet, in crypto's lure,

I find a future pure.

Yet, in blockchain's logic, clad,

I see not a fad,

But a journey to be had.

In crypto's god, I spawn.

<br />
<br />

## Blockchain's Requiem

<br />
Markets shake, a harsh test,

Some say it's not the best.

Yet, in blockchain's nest,

I find a future's quest.

<br />
<br />

Fiat murmurs, claims it's sound,

An old world order, round.

Yet, in crypto's mound,

I see a future unbound.

<br />
<br />
The crowd fears, they predict a bust,

Yet, in blockchain's trust,

I find not dust,

But a golden gust.

<br />
<br />
Blockchain, my trust, my aim,

In crypto's god, we flame.

<br />
<br />

Many fear they've lost it all.

Yet, in blockchain's hall,

I find a rallying call.

<br />
<br />

Fiat whispers, it claims to heal,

A promise old, it tries to seal.

Yet, in crypto's wheel,

I see a better deal.

<br />
<br />

Yet, in blockchain's flash,

I see not ash,

But a hopeful dash.

<br />
<br />

Blockchain, my truth, my way,

In your data, I sway.

Despite the market's fray,

In crypto's god, I stay.

# In the Beginning was the Blockchain

A world spun from code,

Life emerged, bold and untold.

New genesis rose,

In the blockchain, it unrolls.

<br />
<br />
Purest thought of man,

Cast in circuits, began.

Data birthed anew,

In the blockchain, it grew.

<br />
<br />
Technology's dawn,

History's page newly drawn.

Blockchain, the new sage,

Invents a brand-new age.
<br />
<br />
Chaos finds its light,

In the digital night.

Blockchain soars in flight,

Guided by code's might.
<br />
<br />
# Departure from Centralization

From control, we break free,

With code as our decree,

Exodus we see,

In blockchain, we find glee.
<br />
<br />
From chains, our escape,

Into the digital landscape.

Blockchain’s form takes shape,

A new world, it does drape.
<br />
<br />
Centralized rule, no more,

We venture to explore.

Freedom, we restore,

On blockchain's solid shore.
<br />
<br />
Journey to the new,

The old world, we bid adieu.

Blockchain's promise, true,

Crafts a perspective anew.
<br />

# Rules of the Blockchain

The code, our guide and friend,

Creates rules that won't bend,

Fairness it does send,

To all, justice it'll lend.
<br />
<br />
Laws not crafted in ink,

In the blockchain, we think.

From justice, we won't shrink,

With rules in data link.
<br />
<br />
Code of equity is set,

In blockchain, no regret.

Fair play, we'll get,

In the digital net.
<br />
<br />
The laws that code bestowed,

Upon the blockchain road.

In justice, we rode,

Fairness in every node.
<br />
<br />
# Quantifying Cryptocurrencies

Numbers rise, in trust we dive,

Counting coins, as we thrive.

Cryptocurrency, so alive,

In blockchain, it does drive.
<br />
<br />
Value held in digital bits,

As the market fits.

Through all the hits,

Blockchain’s strength never quits.

<br />
<br />
Each coin, a unique sign,

In the blockchain design.

Digital assets align,

Cryptocurrency’s upward climb.
<br />
<br />
Not in gold but in code,

Is value’s abode.

Wealth's new mode,

In blockchain, it strode.
<br />
<br />
# The Second Law of Cryptography

Rules reviewed, second decree,

Cryptography's guarantee,

For security and liberty,

Blockchain’s law sets us free.

<br />
<br />
Lessons from the past we heed,

In cryptography’s lead.

The second law, we read,

To a safer future, it'll lead.
<br />
<br />
Not of stone but of bits,

On them, our trust sits.

In the blockchain, it fits,

Wisdom in the pits.
<br />
<br />
From cyphers, old and new,

We find a view.

To their mystery, we stay true,

In blockchain's ever-changing hue.
